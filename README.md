# Guess the Number

This project is an implementation of a [number guessing game][1]. It is written in HTML5, and should work on all modern browsers.

Unlike other guessing games though, this one doesn't let you win. No matter how many times you try, you will never guess the number. And to rub it in, the game keeps a permanent counter showing how many times you've lost. In fact, the code has no concept of a single "number" to be guessed; the whole exchange is a farce, designed to distract you from the realization that you've already lost, your friends don't really like you, your life's work has no meaning, you will die alone...

But yeah go fork it on GitHub! Or something.
